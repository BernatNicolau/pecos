v0.1.9 (master)
--------------------------

* Added quality control tests that allow the user to supply a custom function.  The functionality includes a stationary and streaming framework.  
   * The streaming framework that loops through the data using a moving window to determine if the each single data point is normal or anomalous.  If the data point is deemed anomalous it is omitted from the history and not used to determine the status of subsequent data points.  The outlier test can make use of the streaming framework.
   * The stationary framework operates on the entire data set, and while it can include operations like moving windows, it does not update the history based on the test results.
* Added the ability to create monitoring reports using a Latex template. 
* Bug fix in the way masks are generated.  Data points that have Null values were always assigned to False, indicating 
  that a quality control test failed.  Null values are now assumed to be True, unless a specific test fails (e.g. check_missing).
